# Selenide Reporter

A reporting framework for the Selenide UI testing tool.

## Elevator Pitch

[Selenide](https://selenide.org/) is a fluent API for [Selenium Webdriver](https://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) and very likely the best way to write concise UI tests in Java. But in terms of reporting functionality it relies on generic tooling and some [basic integrations](https://selenide.org/documentation/reports.html).

Therefore this framework aims to add the following features to Selenide:
- opinionated reporting: a way to structure your tests.
- custom reporting: you decide what should be in the report.
- modern visuals (as provided by [Extent Reports](https://github.com/extent-framework/extentreports-java)).
